Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
Image Previews: Displays images related to the news articles.
News Details: Provides a summary of each news article with a "Read More" link.


# Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
Styling: CSS (with custom theme variables for dark/light mode)
API: News API for fetching articles
State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (comes with Node.js)

The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173.

# How It Works
1. Fetching News:
The app fetches news articles based on the selected search term using the News API.
The search term defaults to "India" but can be changed by the user.
2. Dark/Light Mode Toggle:
The app allows users to switch between light and dark modes. The selected theme is saved in the browser's local storage for persistence.
3. News Display:
The news articles are displayed in card format, showing the article's title, description, and an image (if available).
Each card has a "Read More" link that redirects to the full article.
